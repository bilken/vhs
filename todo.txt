It appears that the video is 29.97 or 30 fps even though the v4l2 says 25 (that's just a default)
I get audio/video glitches if I use 25 but 30 seems smooth.

Can I merge the blank avoidance into the capture process?
* Use a TS with blank capture built in?
* Can also display to see what's up

Can a phone play a ts or mp4 clip?
Can I make fragmented mp4 directly?
Does byte-range hls work with these TS clips? Can I use a crappy python web server?
