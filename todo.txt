It appears that the video is 29.97 or 30 fps even though the v4l2 says 25 (that's just a default)
I get audio/video glitches if I use 25 but 30 seems smooth.

Why can't I play ffmpeg's ts clips with totem but I can play vlc's? View vlc's underlying command?

Figure out optimal encoder settings quality vs performance


Can I merge the blue avoidance into the capture process?
Can a phone play a ts or mp4 clip?
Can I make fragmented mp4 directly?
